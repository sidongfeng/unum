This floating-point arithmetic library contains a software 
implementation of Universal Numbers (unums) in 'C' as described by 
John Gustafson in the book "The End of Error: Unum Computing". The 
implementation is patterned after the prototype code printed in the 
book. A download of the Mathematica code is available from the 
publisher's website:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Simple process for compilaton and running

1. Install GMP, it is a required library
2. Direct to the top level directory of the distribution
2. ./configure
3. make check
4. ./tests/tbasic

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Required library

The unum library uses the GNU Multiple Precision (GMP) Arithmetic 
Library for the low-level arithmetic. GMP (http://gmplib.org/) 
must be installed or accessible on your system to build and use the
unum library. You are available to install GMP to a custom location,
then define the following environment variables before running 
"./configure". 

    export CPPFLAGS=-I<path to GMP include>
    export LDFLAGS=-L<path to libgmp>

After configuring the distribution with "./configure", the existing test
programs can be executed in a batch by running "make check" from the top 
level directory of the distribution. Once built, they can be 
individually run at the command line from the "tests" directory. 
    
    make check
    ./tests/tbasic

tbasic is a file that to test the arithmetic operations. I implement few
tests to check the correctness of logarithm, exponential and power 
functions in both unum and ubound type. The file contains a testing in time
between math library and unum for evaluation.
